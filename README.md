### Hello, I'm Syamil ðŸ‘‹

- My interdisciplinary [research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mQUFzL8AAAAJ&hl=en) is at the intersection of machine learning, earth science and flow physics. I interface current ML/DL tools with domain-specific tools to solve complex problems in dynamical systems. 
- I aspire to make ML/DL more accessible and explainable to practicioners. 
- I worked in the energy industry for 5 years developing spatial and numerical subsurface models.
- BS CS UMich'13, MS CS USC'22 & PhD PE USC'23. Let's connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsyamil/">LinkedIn</a>!
- I enjoy running and hiking. I've summited Mt. Kinabalu, Mt. Cotopaxi and trekked the GR20 and Roraima plateau. I hope to climb one of the eight-thousanders soon!
